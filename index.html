                <p>
                    Hi! I’m Kate Heyman, a pre-business marketing student at Brigham Young University.
                    I grew up in the Bay Area and moved to Utah before high school, which gave me a love
                    for new experiences and meeting different people.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of school, I love staying active. I ran track and played soccer in high school,
                    enjoy skiing, and completed the St. George Marathon in 2025. I also enjoy using Spanish
                    in everyday conversation and work settings.
                </p>
